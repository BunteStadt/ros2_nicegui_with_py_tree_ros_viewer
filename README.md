# ros2_nicegui_with_py_tree_ros_viewer
Minimal working py_tree_ros_viewer as webapp

run the ros package.

Make sure some py_trees_ros node is running with a tree.

Only one, the default Namespace for the snapshot stream is supported and automaticaly connected.

Look at the ino messages for the url, default should be: http://127.0.0.1:8080/tree

I used this sup url to have my mockup and controles etc. on the mainpage.

For this demo, the mainpage is empty.
